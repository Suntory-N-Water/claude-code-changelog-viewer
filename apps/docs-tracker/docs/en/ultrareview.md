# Ultrareview

> Run a deep multi-agent code review with /ultrareview.

Ultrareview requires Claude Code v2.1.111 or later and Claude Opus 4.7.

`/ultrareview` runs a deep multi-agent code review over the changes on your current branch. It spawns parallel bug-hunting subagents to find issues, adversarially verifies each finding to filter out false positives, and returns a ranked list of confirmed problems.

Use Ultrareview before opening a pull request when you want higher confidence than a single-pass review provides.

Full documentation for Ultrareview is coming soon.
